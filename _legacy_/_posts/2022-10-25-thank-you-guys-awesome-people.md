One of the most memorable moments when I wrote my PhD thesis was writing the acknowledgments. Sometimes I get too emotional, not only because I realise this journey is ending but also because I feel soooo grateful for the support and guidance from many amazing people around me. So I wrote this thank you note in my thesis, although it should have been more than this.

**Acknowledgements:**  
First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisors, [Associate Professor Scott Beatson](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=MOdSebYAAAAJ) and [Dr Brian Forde](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=tmgD5hkAAAAJ&hl=en), for all their supervision, guidance, and mentorship since I joined the lab five years ago. To Scott, thank you for letting me join your lab and project and for introducing me to the world of visualisation and microbial genomics. Without your guidance, I would never have been on this path, and I am extremely grateful to you. I also thank you for providing me with tremendous opportunities in academic, research, and development work to grow my knowledge and skills throughout my candidature. To Brian, thank you for letting me join the Queensland Genomics project and study the VREfm dataset. This project has significantly helped me learn more about genomics. I also thank you for your constant presence, feedback, and all the priceless discussions that greatly improve my research and coding skills. To both of you, I cannot thank you enough for sharing this incredible scientific journey.

I also would like to greatly thank [Professor Mark Schembri](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=ITBy6dQAAAAJ&hl=en), the chair of my thesis panel, for his constructive feedback and keeping me on track throughout my candidature. I thank [Associate Professor Mikael Boden](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=c94OdU0AAAAJ) for his input during my candidature review. I also would like to thank [Dr Patrick Harris](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=RDMNW5IAAAAJ) for his significant contributions, reviews, and input on almost all the works presented in this thesis.

I also thank all the staff from the UQ Graduate School, SCMB, Pathology Queensland, UQCCR and all the participating hospitals for their project support and administrative assistance that make my candidature possible.

To [Beatson lab](https://beatsonlab.com) members and peers: Areej, Melinda, Leah, Nhu, Cameron, Rhys, David, Thom, Caitlin, Lida, and Sith, thank you for all the laughs, support, and good memories over these last five years. I thank Leah for all her help during the early development of HAIviz. I also thank Rhys, who was here with me to share the journey from the beginning. I especially thank Thom, who always patiently explains how the complex computing world works.

I thank my friends and my Lembang family for their presence and support emotionally and physically. I also thank Mbak El, Jan and family for your generous love for Kalun, Rinda and me.

Last and most importantly, I would like to thank my family for their constant support and encouragement. To Mamah and Ayah, thank you for your endless love, prays, and faith in me to complete this journey. This work is dedicated to you. To Rinda, my dearest wife, thank you for always being a cheerful, strong, and independent woman. This journey would never have been this enjoyable without you. To Kalun, my baby, thank you for always making my day happier. You are the greatest gift of my life.
