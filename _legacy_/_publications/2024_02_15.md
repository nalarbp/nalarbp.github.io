**Abstract**

Background: Existing tools for phylogeographic and epidemiological visualisation primarily provide a macro-geographic view of epidemic and pandemic transmission events but offer little support for detailed investigation of outbreaks in healthcare settings. Here, we present HAIviz, an interactive web-based application designed for integrating and visualising genomic epidemiological information to improve the tracking of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). HAIviz displays and links the outbreak timeline, building map, phylogenetic tree, patient bed movements, and transmission network on a single interactive dashboard. HAIviz has been developed for bacterial outbreak investigations but can be utilised for general epidemiological investigations focused on built environments for which visualisation to customised maps is required. This paper describes and demonstrates the application of HAIviz for HAI outbreak investigations..
