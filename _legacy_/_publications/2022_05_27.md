**Abstract**  
_Motivation:_ Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is revolutionizing disease surveillance where it facilitates high-resolution clustering of related organism and outbreak detection. However, visualizing and efficiently communicating genomic data back to clinical staff is crucial for the successful deployment of a targeted infection control response.

_Results:_ CATHAI (cluster analysis tool for healthcare-associated infections) is an interactive web-based visualization platform that couples WGS informed clustering with associated metadata, thereby converting sequencing data into informative and accessible clinical information for the management of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) and nosocomial outbreaks.

_Availability and implementation:_ All code associated with this application are free available from https://github.com/FordeGenomics/cathai. A demonstration version of CATHAI is available online at https://cathai.fordelab.com.
