  introduction: `I am a bioinformatician by training with focus in microbial genomics research, and web-based visualisation tool or pipeline development. My research revolves around the genomic epidemiology of multi-drug resistant bacteria in healthcare settings. I am comfortable working with a large-scale bacterial genome datasets and analysis using various bioinformatics tools and pipelines. I am also incredibly passionate in web-based software design, and have been enjoying to design and implement web user interface (UI) using various Javascript frameworks and libraries. As a bioinformatician, I also comfortable with High-Performance Computing, Unix commands, R, and Python programming.`,
